'''Summary'''<br />
<br />
This is an Operational BUIP requesting BU membership approval for the expenditure to hold a small conference for the purpose of bringing together noted* Bitcoin developers to overview, discuss, critique and prioritize many of the leading software enhancements which enable a far higher capacity for transactional throughput ''on-chain.''<br />
* active developers of any full-node implementation who also support the on-chain scaling ethos.<br />
<br />
'''Objectives'''<br />
<br />
This conference has several strands:

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><blockquote><p>Reaffirmation of Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision described in his 2008 whitepaper and later forum correspondence.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Make the case for multiple implementations, i.e. decentralized development, resolving the last major centralizing force within the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Presentations: Selected items drawn from the Bitcoin Unlimited proposed development [https://bitco.in/forum/threads/bitcoin-unlimited-proposed-development-roadmap.1401/ ''roadmap''].</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Panel and breakout discussions to debate specific on-chain scaling changes</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Networking: CTOs from Bitcoin ecosystem businesses will be invited to participate.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Prepare the groundwork for paid developers to enhance BU full-node software on a per-project basis which are approved by technical BUIPs.</p></blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote><p>Publicity for BU itself as a growing centre of development excellence for Bitcoin full-node software.</p></blockquote></li></ol>
